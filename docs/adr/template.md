# [Short Title of Solved Problem and Solution]

* **State**: [Draft | Decided | Obsolete]
* **Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Context and Problem Statement

[Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., "We need to filter network packets efficiently based on IP subnets and ports..."]

## Decision Drivers

* [Driver 1, e.g., "Must handle CIDR ranges / subnets"]
* [Driver 2, e.g., "Latency must be sub-microsecond per packet"]
* [Driver 3, e.g., "Memory usage constrained to X MB"]

## Considered Options

* [Option 1]
* [Option 2]
* [Option 3]

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[Option 1]", because [justification. e.g., "it offers the only viable performance profile..."].

### Positive Impacts

* [e.g., Simplifies packet processing logic]
* [e.g., Reducing memory footprint by 40%]

### Negative Impacts

* [e.g., Increases complexity in the user-space loader]
* [e.g., Requires kernel version 5.x+]
